# countries_of_the_world
My favourite Kaggle dataset so far - countries of the world. Analysing, visualising, feature engineering, modelling.
Born out of a growing interest in geopolitics and economics of different countries. 
The simplicity of this tabular dataset also provides me a great starting point for exploring various aspects of data science, from manipulation to cleaning, from aggregating to visualising, to modelling and insights generation.

# Analysing and finding interesting insights 
* countries with outlier characteristics
* correlation between countries in terms of predictors
* visualisation
* etc

# Modelling 
* clustering 
* linear models, lasso selection
* non linear methods: GAMs
* neural networks
* feature selection
