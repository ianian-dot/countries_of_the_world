# countries_of_the_world
My favourite Kaggle dataset so far - countries of the world. Analysing, visualising, feature engineering, modelling.

# Analysing and finding interesting insights 
* countries with outlier characteristics
* correlation between countries in terms of predictors
* visualisation
* etc

# Modelling 
* linear models, lasso selection
* non linear methods: GAMs
* neural networks
* feature selection
